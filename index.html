                                Ed Sivick is a Mechanical Engineer who is improving his skill set through The
                                George Washington University to become a Full Stack Web Developer. As an accomplished
                                Engineer, Ed has won several employer awards including the annual President's Excellence
                                Award in the Innovation and Technology category at Northrop Grumman. Ed and his team
                                played a critical role in the deployment of several systems engineering projects that
                                were utilized as part of the Northrop Grumman Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) program.

                                Ed earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of
                                Pittsburgh. Early in his career, he had the opportunity to work as both a Mechanical and
                                Software Engineer at Design Integrated Technology. The company designs and manufactures
                                pressure vessels, industrial mixers, and propellant test equipment. Many systems were
                                integrated with Data Acquisition and Control (DAQ) programs that Ed developed using
                                LabVIEW.

                                Ed later worked as a Mechanical Engineer for Mantech Test Systems, Northrop Grumman, and
                                Digital Signal Corporation. At each of these companies he designed mechanical systems
                                using AutoCad and SolidWorks which are 3D computer-aided drafting (CAD) software
                                applications. He oversaw the mechanical development from design to prototype, and final
                                production. These systems were later utilized by the US armed forces of The Army, Navy,
                                Air Force, and Marine Corps.

                                Ed continues to utilize SolidWorks to design and fabricate new consumer based products.
                                With the acceptance of these products, he hopes to help those with hand dexterity issues
                                as well as reduce the amount of yard debris that is sent to Waste Management facilities
                                or landfills.

                                Ed has completed previous contract work in which he developed and revised website
                                content files using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is his desire to expand this skill set
                                by applying the same focus and attention to detail from his mechanical design background
                                as a full stack web developer.
