                    <strong>Project Description:</strong><br>
                    Business and leisure travel to many states or countries can be difficult if you are not equipped
                    with the proper attire, or knowledge of specific holidays in that area. The ability to view this
                    information before visiting the region can save the traveler time and effort through pre-planning.
                    The travel input criteria including: visiting city, start travel date, and end travel date will
                    initialize a server-side API from <a href="https://calendarific.com/">Calendarific</a>, providing
                    them with holiday information as well as useful facts about their destination. Information
                    pertaining
                    to the destination country is supplied to the app by means of an API from
                    <a href="https://restcountries.eu/#rest-countries">Rest Countries</a>. The traveler can also utilize
                    the weather information for that destination, and select the proper clothing or make appropriate
                    plans
                    to adjust for it. The input data is used to initiate another server-side API from
                    <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather</a> to provide the weather information. The date
                    information is displayed using <a href="https://momentjs.com/">Moment.js</a>.

                    The user clicks the <strong>Generate Password</strong> button to generate a password.
                    The password criteria are:<br>
                    - The length of the password must be between 8 and 128 characters.<br>
                    - The user must select at least 1 of the 4 groups of characters listed below:<br>
                    - lower case letters<br>
                    - upper case letters<br>

                    also features a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to
                    multiple screen sizes. When the user clicks a start button, a timer will start and the user is
                    presented with a question. When the question is answered, another question is presented. If the
                    question is answered incorrectly, additional time is subtracted from the timer. The game is over
                    when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0. The user can then save their initials and
                    quiz score.

                    This is an application that creates a daily planner to manage time effectively by posting hourly
                    events and/or tasks into assigned timeblocks. The current day is displayed at the top of the
                    calendar. Timeblocks in the form of rows are assigned for standard business hours (9AM to 5PM).
                    When viewing timeblocks for the current day, each block is color coded to indicate whether that
                    specific block is in the past, present, or future. When the user clicks on a timeblock, they are
                    able to enter an event or task associated with that time period. They can save the information by
                    pressing the corresponding save button for that timeblock. The information is then saved into
                    local storage.

                        weather for a city. The user is able to input a city and view its relative weather data.
                        The city name, date, and weather icon representing the weather on the current date will appear.
                        The temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index will also appear below the city name and
                        date. The UV index will be color coded to identify the severity: favorable (green),
                        moderate (yellow), or severe (orange-red-violet). The future weather will be displayed as a
                        5-day forecast displaying the date; a weather icon representing the weather on that date;
                        the temperature, and the humidity. The user will be able to click on a city stored in the search
                        history, and again view its current and future weather. When re-opening the app, it will display
                        the current and future weather for the last city that was searched. If there were no cities
                        searched, it will display the weather for New York, New York.
